select * from actor
-- 1. Count how many actors are in the table.
select count(1) from actor
-- 2. Try to add a new actor with some blank fields. What do you think the outcome will be ?
	-- should be an error cuz columns are "not null"
insert into actor(first_name)
values('Jack')
	--should be working only if all the "not null fields" are filled
insert into actor(first_name,last_name)
values('Jack','Samurai')
